# Project MongoDB Commerce

First project where I use the MongoDB database, this being a simple project, composed of queries that access a database that simulates a McDonald's menu.

All created queries are in the [challenges](./challenges/) directory.

## Queries created

[**Challenge1**](./challenges/challenge1.js): Returns the number of documents in the `products` collection;

[**Challenge2**](./challenges/challenge2.js): Returns the name and quantity of sold snacks, with sold snacks sorted in ascending order;

## Stack used

**Database:** [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
